## Product Page Update Issues - Resolved

### Issue Summary
The products page and product detail pages were not properly displaying updated content and images. After investigation, we identified and resolved several key issues:

1. **Multiple Product Data Files**: The application had two separate product data files (`products.ts` and `products.js`) causing conflicts.
2. **TypeScript Type Definition Issues**: The TypeScript interface in `products.ts` was incomplete and not properly integrated with the actual data in `products.js`.
3. **Caching Issues**: Next.js caching was preventing updates from being reflected on the frontend.

### Solutions Implemented

1. **Unified Product Data Source**:
   - Modified `products.ts` to properly import and re-export the JavaScript product data from `products.js` with correct TypeScript typings
   - Removed duplicated product definitions to ensure a single source of truth

2. **Fixed TypeScript Interface**:
   - Updated the `Product` interface to match all properties available in the actual data
   - Made category and images fields optional with proper type definitions

3. **Cache Clearing Strategy**:
   - Implemented a process to completely clear the Next.js cache when making structural changes
   - Restarted the development server with a clean `.next` directory to ensure changes were properly reflected

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Added visual indicators to the pages to confirm updates were applied
   - Verified product image paths and confirmed image loading for the gallery component

### Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Data Organization**:
   - Maintain a single source of truth for product data
   - Consider using a database or CMS for product information to simplify management

2. **TypeScript Best Practices**:
   - Ensure interfaces are kept in sync with actual data structures
   - Use strict typing to catch potential issues early in development

3. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Document the caching behavior for team members
   - Implement proper cache invalidation for production deployments

4. **Testing Protocol**:
   - Develop automated tests to verify product data integrity
   - Implement visual regression testing for UI components

### Commands for Troubleshooting

When implementing updates to product data or related components, use these commands to ensure changes are properly reflected:

```bash
# Stop any running Next.js processes
pkill -f next

# Remove the Next.js cache
rm -rf .next

# Restart the development server
npm run dev
```

These steps should be followed whenever making changes to data structures or components that might be affected by caching.
